CatReNet (formerly CatlyNet) is a program for working with (auto-)catalytic reaction networks, based on a set of
'catalyzed reactions' and a given 'food set' of molecules  [[HXS24b]](#70).
It provides fast and exact algorithms for calculating three main types of autocatalytic networks,
namely (maximal) RAFs, CAFs, and pseudo-RAFs. These three notions are formalizations of the concept of a 'collectively
autocatalytic set' originally introduced by Stuart Kauffman. Several other algorithms are also implemented.
The program can visualize a CRS and animate the emergence of a maximal auto-catalytic network.
CatReNet was first introduced as CatlyNet in [[SXH20]](#25).

CatReNet is written in Java using JavaFX and
is loosely based on a web application written by Dietrich Radel: http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/bio/RAF/.
This software was developed by Daniel H. Huson, Joana C. Xavier and Mike A. Steel, see [[HXS24b]](#70).

## Main features

Input to CatReNet is a catalytic reaction system (CRS), which consists of a list of catalyzed reactions and a food set
of molecules, specified like this example consisting of two food items and three (one-way) reactions:

```
Food: f1 f2

r1 : f2 [f1,p3] => p1
r2 : p1 [f2] => p2
r3 : p2 [p1] => p3
```

Several algorithms are available that aim at computing certain 'auto-catalytic' subsystems.
The three main calculations are the computation of a "maxRAF"
(maximal RAF, reflexively autocatalytic f-generated system), a maxCAF (maximal CAF, constructively autocatalytic and
f-generated system)
and a maxPseudoRAF (maximal pseudo RAF) of a CRS.

The program can display a CRS as a network, in several ways. Moreover, it can animate the emergence of a Max RAF, Max
CAF
or Max Pseudo RAF.

## Algorithms and heuristics

In more detail, the program provides the following calculations:

- Max RAF Algorithm - computes the maximal RAF [[HMS15]](#10) (see also  [[H23]](#40))
- Max CAF Algorithm - computes the maximal CAF [[HMS15]](#10)
- Max Pseudo RAF Algorithm - computes the maximal Pseudo RAF [[HMS15]](#10)
- Strictly Autocatalytic Max RAF Algorithm - computes a Max RAF that has the additional property that any contained
  reaction requires at least one molecule type for catalyzation that is not in the food set [[HXS24]](#60)
- Min RAF-Generating Given Element Algorithm - Identifies a subset of the Max RAF that is (i) a RAF and (ii) generates a
  given element x
  (not in the food set) and (iii) which is minimal amongst all such sets satisfying (i) and (ii).
- Trivial CAFs Algorithm - computes all reactions that can run using only the food set
- Trivial RAFs Algorithm - computes all reactions that can run using only the food set, where the catalyst need not be
  in the food set if the reaction produces it
- Core RAF Algorithm - computes the unique irreducible RAF, if it exists (Section 4.1 of [[SXH20]](#25))
- Quotient RAF Algorithm - computes the Max RAF minus all the reactions from the Max CAF and adds all produces of the
  Max CAF to the food set [[SXH20]](#25)
- Remove Trivial RAFs Algorithm - computes CRS that is obtained by removing all trivial RAFs
- Min iRAF Heuristic - searches for a smallest irreducible RAF in a heuristic fashion [[HXS24b]](#50)
- MU CAF Algorithm - computes one maximal uninhibited CAF
- U RAF Algorithm - computes a max RAF, removes inhibited reactions, and then recomputes the max RAF
  (Section 6 of [[HMS16]](#20))
- Run MU CAF Multiple Times... - Runs the MU CAF algorithm multiple times, using different orderings of the input
  reactions
- Determine Necessarily Spontaneous in RAF - determine those reactions that must initially run uncatalyzed and then
  beome catalyzed later
- Greedily Grow MaxCAF to MaxRAF - greedily grow maxCAF to maxRAF by making reactions spontaneous
- Compute Reaction Dependencies - computes the graph of dependencies between all food-set generated
  reactions [[HXS24]](#60)
- Compute Molecule Dependencies - computes the graph of dependencies between all molecules [[HXS24]](#60)
- Compute Importance - computes the percent difference between model size and model size without given food
  item [[HS23]](#50)

In addition, the program provides an implementation of Kauffman's  'binary polymer model'.
This features generates a system consisting of all polymers (over a finite alphabet)
of length at most n, with ligation-cleavage reactions, and with catalysis assigned randomly (each molecule catalysing on
average m reactions).

### Export computed systems

Any of the computed subsystems can be exported to a new file.

## Network visualization

The program can represent a CRS using several types of networks:

- Full network - this shows all reactions, food items, reactants, produces and catalysts as nodes connected by directed
  edges.
- Association Network - reactions are shown as nodes and a directed edge from one reaction to the other indicates that
  the one reaction produces a reactant or catalyst for the other
- Reactant Association Network - reactions are shown as nodes and a directed edge indicates that one reaction produces a
  reactant for the other.
- Reaction-Dependency Network - shows dependencies between reactions (this feature requires testing and debugging)
- Molecule-Dependency Network - show dependencies between molecules (this feature requires testing and debugging)

There are a several options:

- Suppress Formal Food Item - if there is a formal food item present, which is used to implement "catalyst-free"
  reactions, then selecting this option will hide it
- Suppress Catalyst Edges - select this to hide catalyst edges
- Use Multicopy Food Nodes - select this to show each food node multiple times, to produce a less tangled network
- Show/Hide Node Labels - select to hide node labels

### Other calculations

- Reaction Precedence DAG â€“ A directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures the partial ordering of reactions based on their dependencies: if an admissible ordering of reactions exists (ignoring catalysts), this graph represents which reactions must occur before others.

### Animation

The program can animate the emergence of three types of systems:

- Animate Max RAF - in this animation, uncatalyzed reactions run at a low rate, as long as all reactants are present.
- Animate Max CAF - reactions only run (at full rate) when catalyzed and all reactants are present.
- Animate Max Pseudo RAF - same as Max RAF, but additionally, molecules that are not being produced can spontaneously
  arise at a low rate.

Run long enough, in each case, the set of reactions running at full rate, together with the assoicated food sources,
constitutes a subsytem of the animated type.

There are several options:

- Animate Inhibitions - if inhibitions are present in the input CRS, then animate them
- Move Labels - during animation, move copies of the molecule-type labels along the edges rather than just disks
- Use Colors - during animation, give different molecules different colors
- Network Embbedder Iterations - set the number of iterations used by the algorithm that computes the layout of the
  network

### Export network

The network can be exported as an image in these formats: PNG, SVG and PDF.

## Commandline tools

The Linux and MacOS distributions have a tools directory that contains two commandline programs:

- catrenet-tool - runs the implemented algorithms on one or more CRS input files
- polymer-tool - generates a set of CRS input files using the binary polymer model
